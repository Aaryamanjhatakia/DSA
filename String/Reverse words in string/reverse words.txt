Problem Statement: Given a string s, reverse the words of the string.

Example 1:
Input: s=”this is an amazing program”
Output: “program amazing an is this”

Example 2:
Input: s=”This is decent”
Output: “decent is This”

Approach:
We start traversing the string from the end until we hit a space. It indicates that we have gone past a word and now we need to store it.
We check if our answer variable is empty or not
If it’s empty, it indicates that this is the last word we need to print, and hence, there shouldn’t be any space after this word.
If it’s empty we add it to our result with a space after it. Here’s a quick demonstration of the same


Loop through each character:
ch = 'T' → temp = "T"

ch = 'U' → temp = "TU"

ch = 'F' → temp = "TUF"

ch = ' ' (space)

ans = "TUF"

temp = ""

ch = 'i' → temp = "i"

ch = 's' → temp = "is"

ch = ' '

ans = "is TUF" (adds is in front)

temp = ""

ch = 'g' → temp = "g"

ch = 'r' → temp = "gr"

ch = 'e' → temp = "gre"

ch = 'a' → temp = "grea"

ch = 't' → temp = "great"

ch = ' '

ans = "great is TUF"

temp = ""

(And so on...)
