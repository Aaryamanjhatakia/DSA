Problem Statement: Given the head of a singly linked list of `n` nodes and an integer `k`, where k is less than or equal to `n`. 
Your task is to reverse the order of each group of `k` consecutive nodes, if `n` is not divisible by `k`, then the last group of remaining nodes should remain unchanged.
