Approach:

Take a single queue.
push(x): Push the element in the queue.
Use a for loop of size()-1, remove element from queue and again push back to the queue, hence the most recent element becomes the most former element and vice versa.
pop(): remove the element from the queue.
top(): show the element at the top of the queue.
size(): size of the current queue.
Repeat step3 at every insertion of the element.
