Base Case: If the current node is null, it means we have reached the end of a subtree and there are no further nodes to explore. Hence the recursive function stops and we return from that particular recursive call.

Recursive Function:


Traverse Left Subtree: Explore the left subtree by recursively invoking the postorder function on the left child of the current node, ensuring a depth-first approach to node exploration.
Traverse Right Subtree: After fully traversing the left subtree, we move on to the right subtree, invoking the postorder function on the right child of the current node.
Process Current Node: After exploring the children of the current node, we process it by adding its value to the postorder traversal array.
