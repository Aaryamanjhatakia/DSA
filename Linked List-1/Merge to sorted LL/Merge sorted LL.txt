Problem Statement: Given two sorted linked lists, merge them to produce a combined sorted linked list. Return the head of the final linked list created.

Algorithm

Step 1: Initialise two pointers, t1 and t2 to the heads of the input linked lists. Create a dummyNode with value -1 that will serve as the starting point of the merged list. 
Use a temp pointer to traverse and build the combined merged list.

Step 2: While t1 and t2 are not null:

Compare the values of t1 and t2, connect the node with smaller value to the temp pointer of the merged combined list.
Move the temp pointer and the respective t1 and t2 pointer to their next nodes.

Step 3: Attach the remaining nodes of the non-empty list directly to the temp pointer as they are already sorted.

Step 4: Return the next of the dummyNode as the head of the merge sorted linked list.
